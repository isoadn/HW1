    "# Prelude: Why use computer programming in Physics?  \n",
    "-------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "Physics is the quest to explain and understand natural phenomena with simple elegant models.   Classical mechanics is contained in Newtons three laws and electromagnetism, the subject of this course, is contained in Maxwell's four equations: \n",
    "         $$\\nabla \\cdot \\vec B = 0 $$\n",
    "         $$\\nabla \\cdot \\vec E = -\\frac {\\rho} {\\epsilon_0} $$\n",
    "         $$\\nabla \\times \\vec B = \\mu_0 \\vec J + \\mu_0 \\epsilon_0 \\frac {d\\vec E}{dt}$$\n",
    "         $$\\nabla \\times \\vec E = -\\frac {d\\vec B}{dt}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The fact that these laws can explain phenomena as diverse as rainbows, magnets, and plasmas is one of the most stunning intellectual achievements of humankind.  However, the simplicity and elegance of these equations masks the  richness and complexity of the phenomena they can describe.   Computation allows us to take these laws and make detailed predictions about complicated systems.   These computations help us build intuition about our physical laws, allow us to test our theory by comparing to measurements with observations, and enable us to make predictions.  Computation is a crucial tool needed to fully realize the power of our fundamental physical laws as a description of nature in all its complexity. \n",
    "\n",
    "Even just a few years, ago mathematics in the form of pencil and paper calculations was the only tool available to students at this level.  This meant that courses like Physics 260 were restricted to very simple, idealized physical systems. Now, nearly every working physicist uses a computer on a daily basis to solve research problems that would otherwise be difficult if not impossible.  Research groups use Jupyter notebooks very similar to this one to perform original research, collaborate, and share methods. The incorporation of numerical methods into the curriculum offers several advantages for your learning: it allows you to better understand physics through visualization, and it lets you easily solve problems that are hard or perhaps can't be done on paper.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is even a jupyter notebook tutorial for the analysis that detected gravitational waves!!! (see https://github.com/losc-tutorial/LOSC_Event_tutorial/blob/master/index.ipynb)\n",
    "\n",
    "Beyond these narrow benefits, understanding how to use computation to solve problems will prepare you for a variety of careers including Physics, Engineering, Finance, Data Science, or any number of other fields. The python programming language in particular is extremely powerful and is widely used across numerous areas of study both inside and outside academia.\n"

    "-------------------\n",
    "The **learning goals** for this assignment are: \n",
    "1.  Gain familiarity with jupyter notebooks and with the numpy and matplotlib libraries \n",
    "2.  Calculate and visualize the field distribution of an electric dipole by using the superposition principle. \n",

    "## What is a Jupyter Notebook?\n",
    "\n",
    "A jupyter notebook is comprised of a server that runs Python in the background (typically this a process on your computer, but it can be remote on a different computer) and interacts through a webpage.  The interactive webpage stores text, code, and output in one place allowing for very well documented and well organized code and results.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The Python kernel running in the background is very efficient and can be used to solve true cutting edge problems in Science, Engineering, Business, or any other field you can imagine.  Jupyter notebooks are increasing in popularity across research and industry.  For example: (1) jupyter notebooks are used for much of the analysis in astrophysics experiments, (2) major hedge funds and tech start-ups use these for code development.  The jupyter notebook is a teaching tool, a wonderful framework for accessing Python, and a state of the art computer language with extensive libraries for visualization, data analysis, and many other tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "The web interface provides boxes for text (called 'markdown' in the pulldown menu above) and boxes for code (called 'code' in the same menu).  You can use the Insert tab to add more boxes to a notebook as you see fit.  This allows you to write descriptions of the code in the same notebook as you write the computer code.  This leads to very understandable code that is fully documented.  For example you can write a description of the problem you are solving and methods you will use before you write the code.   This code can then be executed within the confines of the notebook with the results being automatically placed into the notebook.  This results in a living document that can evolve as you solve a problem. \n",
    "\n",
    "### running your code:  \n",
    "There are several possible ways to execute the code in a notebook.  The recommended way is to press `shift` and `return`.  You can also use the \"play\" button above to execute the code window that has the cursor in it, or within the \"Cell\" pulldown menu you can select; \"Run All,\" \"Run Above,\" or \"Run Below.\"  Once you get to the portion of this notebook with code blocks (see below) I recommend using the \"Restart & Run All\" option from the Kernel drop down to make sure your code successfully runs from top to bottom. \n",

    "## Review of Coulomb's Law:\n",
    "Coulomb's law gives the force on a point charge $q$ from a second charge $Q$:\n",
    "$$\\vec F = \\frac 1 {4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac {qQ}{{\\mathscr r}^2} \\hat {\\mathscr r}. $$\n",
    "Here $\\vec {\\mathscr r} = \\vec r_q - \\vec r_Q$.  This is a vector which points to the charge we are considering the force as acting on.  Thus if both charges have the same sign we end up with a repulsive force while if they have opposite charges the force becomes attractive.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The electric field is introduced by dividing both sides of coulomb's law by $q$.  This results in $$\\vec E  := \\frac {\\vec F} q = \\frac 1 {4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac {Q}{{\\mathscr r}^2} \\hat {\\mathscr r} $$ \n",
    "Here $\\vec {\\mathscr r} = \\vec r - \\vec r_Q$ where $r$ is the point in space at which we evaluate the field. This is a vector field.   That is, at each point in space we have a vector representing the magnitude and direction of the electric field at that point.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The superposition principle:\n",
    "\n",
    "Force is a vector.  Therefore, if you have two forces $\\vec F_1$ and $\\vec F_2$ acting on one body the total force is just the vector sum: $\\vec F_{tot}  = \\vec F_1 + \\vec F_2$.  If $F_1$ and $F_2$ arise from Coulomb's law (e.g., from two charges at different locations) that are acting on a charge $q$ we can divide both sides of this equation by $q$ to arrive at $\\vec E_{tot} = \\vec E_1 + \\vec E_2$.  This is the superposition principle.  We will use this to calculate the field from two point charges.\n",

    "Python is an interpretive language.  Its power lies in the fact that many people have worked tirelessly to create a wide variety of packages that enhance its abilities to accomplish specific tasks.  For this class we will use numpy (a library for numerical and scientific computing) and matplotlib (a mathematical visualization library).  Occasionally we will use other packages.  When we do this I will let you know what to do. \n",

Note that we are importing numpy as np and pyplot as plt, essentially renaming numpy and pyplot in our code.  Pyplot is the interface we will use to matplotlib tools.   This has been adopted as the standard practice and should be used to facilitate easier reading and debugging of code.  You'll see how to do this in the examples below."
